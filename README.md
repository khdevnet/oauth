## OAuth and OpenId
[OAuth 2.0](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/whats-the-difference-between-oauth-openid-connect-and-saml/) is a framework that controls authorization to a protected resource such as an application or a set of files, while OpenID Connect is industry standards for[Federated authentication](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-federated-identity/).

* OAuth 2.0: If you’ve ever signed up to a new application and agreed to let it automatically source new contacts via Facebook or your phone contacts, then you’ve likely used OAuth 2.0. This standard provides secure **delegated access**. That means an application can take actions or access resources from a server on behalf of the user, without them having to share their credentials. It does this by allowing the identity provider (IdP) to issue tokens to third-party applications with the user’s approval.

* OpenID Connect: If you’ve used your Google to sign in to applications like YouTube, or Facebook to log into an online shopping cart, then you’re familiar with this authentication option. OpenID Connect is an open standard that organizations use to authenticate users. IdPs use this so that users can sign in to the IdP, and then access other websites and apps without having to log in or share their sign-in information.
